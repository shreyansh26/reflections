When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

--When we would want to share information with other people as it can be made public and several contributors can work on it together.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

--Maybe so that we can input the changes whenever we want and don't clutter our local repository with someone else's changes when we are working on something serious ourselves.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

--It helps us to understand the map better and we can know when to merge two things and where it will it be merged , whether it will be a fast merge or not, etc.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

--It would definitely be harder, because GitHub and Git are specially made for this purpose alone. Google Drive and Dropbox are personal one cannot collaborate with others on it because it would include sharing passwords and lack of privacy.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

--It gives us an oppurtunity to experiment and that we can let other people (collaborators) see and verify the code first before we include them in master. It is also used when we have to work on something totally different than th topic and may be required to merge later.
