When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

--When we would want to share information with other people as it can be made public and several contributors can work on it together.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

--Maybe so that we can input the changes whenever we want and don't clutter our local repository with someone else's changes when we are working on something serious ourselves.
