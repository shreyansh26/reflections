What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

--An empty repository is created with no previous commits and no files in it too. We can add files to it and make commits, and start working on it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

-- It provides a platform to us to put our files in the repositorry not as a whole but as many as we want at a time. A working directory is the one from which files will be transferred to the repository and the "repository" is the current repository. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

--When we want to experiment something new, but are afraid it may cuse a problem to the current file. Like while working on a game pdate or making the language change.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

--It gives the structure of various branches, how they are linked and the entire network.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

--Automatic is good when no ambiguity is encountered but manual is important if git runs into a confusion whether or not include both the old and new changes into the merged file(when they are similar).
