What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

--An empty repository is created with no previous commits and no files in it too. We can add files to it and make commits, and start working on it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

-- It provides a platform to us to put our files in the repositorry not as a whole but as many as we want at a time. A working directory is the one from which files will be transferred to the repository and the "repository" is the current repository.
